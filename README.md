# AutomatedPentestCurl
Application to perform Attack on web applications using Curl requests and payload lists

This Application is like a Multiple Request BurpSuite Intruder.



Using the Tool

1. Capture requests and API calls via Burp Proxy.
2. Copy those requests as Curl commands to a file and seperate different requests with a "###" line as delimiter
3. now insert a position tag via $$ $$ (similar to burl intruder)
4. now set the curl request file and payload file in the application and start the request
5. The Tool will insert each payload in each curl request and log the response.
6. It can then be viewed by the user in the result section.


to start the tool run
"python3 server.py"
or 
"./run" or "bash run"
